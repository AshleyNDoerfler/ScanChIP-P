# ScanChIP-P
REU 2023 project

Conformation capture is often sequenced for the entire genome, but recent studies have localized their methods to capture conformation centered around proteins. 
Protein-centric data permits lower cost to process matrix data displaying identified interactions and higher resolution results. 
There are numerous callers that are used to detect topologically associated domains (TADs) from high‚Äêthroughput chromosome conformation capture data sets. 
Topologically associated domains are linked to gene expression, transcription, and functionality of the genome across mammalian species. 
HiChIP, a protein-centric chromatin conformation method. Using HiChIP, can provide higher resolution data used to identify binding patterns of proteins to DNA. 
ScanChIP is a proposed method to identify TAD boundaries from HiChIP. 

ScanChIP implements DBSCAN, a cluster machine learning algorithm to identify clusters of interactions as TADs.
